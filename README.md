# Tello Drone & Scratch Library Program

Welcome to the Scratch and Tello Drone Library Program repository! This project is based on the successful program developed by Dan Lou at Palo Alto City Library, and is now being included in the SJSU iSchool LTI Lab project to share with our partners and the rest of the library world.

This program is designed to teach basic coding concepts using Scratch and Tello drones. Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by MIT, which makes it easy for beginners to learn coding concepts. The Tello drone is a small, affordable drone that can be controlled using code.

Our program is intended for use in libraries and other educational settings, and is designed to be accessible to a wide range of learners. By using Scratch and Tello drones, we hope to engage learners and provide them with a fun and interactive way to learn coding.

In this repository, you will find all the resources you need to implement this program in your own library or educational setting. This includes [lesson PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H4kzaxZzpy5PRoRxw6RpIwBSZsW1XhMGrk17sfJikVg/edit#slide=id.g155bf2e5d64_0_21), [instruction](GetStartedWithScratch.md), and code examples. We encourage you to use and adapt these resources to fit the needs of your learners.

Thank you for your interest in our program, and we hope you find it useful in your own educational endeavors!
