## Step 3 Dive in

### Start a new project

Click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the page and choose "New" to start a new Scratch project.

### Add sprites

Sprites are the characters or objects in your Scratch project. Click on the "Choose a Sprite" button in the bottom-right corner of the stage to add a sprite to your project. You can choose from a library of pre-made sprites or create your own.

### Add code

Code is what makes your sprites move and interact with each other. Drag and drop the code blocks to create your program.

### Test your program

Click on the green "Flag" button in the top-right corner of the stage to test your program. This will run your code and show you how your sprites interact with each other.

### Save your project

Once you're happy with your project, click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the page, and choose "Save to your computer" to save your project as a standalone executable file.

### Import a project

Click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner of the page and choose "Load from your computer" button to import a Scratch project and run it.

These are just some basic steps to get started with Scratch. As you become more familiar with the interface and code blocks, you can start to create more complex programs and explore more advanced features of Scratch.
