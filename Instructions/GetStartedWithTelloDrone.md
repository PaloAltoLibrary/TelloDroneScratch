# Get Started with a DJI Tello Drone

Here is the step-by-step instructions for coding a DJI Tello drone with Scratch.

1. First, make sure you have a DJI Tello drone and a compatible device to program it with. You can use a laptop or desktop computer, and connect it to the DJI Tello Wi-Fi network (This is the network that the drone creates, and it should appear in your device's Wi-Fi settings).

2. Next, open Scratch and select "File" and then "New". This will open a new project.

3. Select "More Blocks" from the bottom of the screen, then select "Add Extension" and then "DJI Tello". This will add the DJI Tello blocks to your Scratch project.

4. Add the "when flag clicked" block to your project, which will trigger your code to run when you click the green flag.

5. Drag the "takeoff" block from the DJI Tello extension to your project, and place it under the "when flag clicked" block. This will make the drone take off when you click the green flag.

6. Add any other commands you want the drone to perform.

7. When you are finished coding, make sure you drag the "land" block as the last block to let the drone land when the project ends. 

8. Click the green flag to run your program. Your drone should perform the commands you programmed and land when it's done.

9. Save your project by selecting "File" and then "Save to your computer". Give your project a name and save it.

That's it! With these steps, you can code your DJI Tello drone with Scratch and make it perform various tasks. You can also try import an example project in this repository into your computer and try it out with your DJI Tello drone.
